# points-on-a-circle

Greetings friends.  This is a fun little exercise I developed using AngularJS 1.5, running on Total.js.  The idea was simple enough: plot a given number of points on a circle using AngularJS. The exercise employs custom `directive`s, utilizing the `$digest` cycle and implements `$parsers`, `$formatters` and `$watch`.

## What to expect.

The interface will enable you to change the number of points, change the radius of the circle and slide the points along the circle by changing their offset.

## Please follow the instructions below and enjoy!

`git clone https://github.com/vkiperman/points-on-a-circle.git`

### How to run the code.

`cd points-on-a-circle`

`npm install total.js`

`cd angularjs`

`node index`

#### Thank you.
